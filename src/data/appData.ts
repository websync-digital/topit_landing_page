  about: `For years, buying mobile data and airtime has been broken. Slow banking apps, clunky forms, failed transactions, and zero rewards.

Today, we are changing that forever.

Meet Topit. It is not just an app — it is the most powerful, effortless connectivity experience ever built. Insanely fast, designed to save you real money, and engineered to just work.

What makes Topit revolutionary:

• Unbelievably Fast Delivery (2 Seconds): Direct, wholesale-priced data across MTN, Airtel, and Glo delivered in under two seconds with zero waiting.
• Curated for the Way You Live: Daily streams, weekly grinds, midnight downloads — tailored bundles with real-time balance tracking.
• Recharge Reimagined: Top up airtime on any Nigerian network with a single fluid swipe.
• Real Cashback on Every Byte: Topit pays you 0.5% instant cashback on every single transaction. Real spendable cash, straight into your wallet.
• Data Automations: Schedule recurring data top-ups daily, weekly, or monthly so you never experience unexpected disconnections.
• Instant Branded Receipts: Download and share professional PDF and PNG transaction receipts with reference tracking.
• Hardware-Level Security: Protected by biometric fingerprint and Face ID authentication with 4-strike security lockout defense.

It is not just better data. It is the future of staying connected.`,
